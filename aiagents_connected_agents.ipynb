    "This is a feature in the Azure AI Foundry Agent Service that allows you to break large tasks into smaller, specialized roles without building a custom orchestrator or hardcoding routing logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "This division of labor helps:\n",
    "- Simplify complex workflows\n",
    "- Improve agent performance and accuracy\n",
    "- Make systems easier to maintain and extend over time\n",
    "\n",
    "Using connected agents to automate workflows offers many benefits:\n",
    "- **No custom orchestration required** - The main agent uses natural language to route tasks, eliminating the need for hardcoded logic.\n",
    "- **Improved reliability and traceability** - The clear separation of responsibilities makes issues easier to debug since agents can be tested individually.\n",
    "- **Flexible and extensible** - Add or swap agents without reworking the entire system or modifying the main agent."
