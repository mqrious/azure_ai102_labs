    "\n",
    "- First, the data/documents is stored somewhere, for example, Azure Blob Storage, or a database, or some other stores.\n",
    "- The **Indexer** connects to the data source, begins to extract and index the data *fields* through an *enrichment pipeline*. The process is also called *document cracking*.\n",
    "- The *document cracking* step uses *skills* to extract the data in many ways. How *Skills* are meant to be executed is based on pre-defined *Skillsets*.\n",
    "- The *fields* in the final result can be mapped into the index fields by 2 ways:\n",
    "    - Are all mapped to the index fields. Can be *implicit*: automatically mapped using the same field names. Or can be *explicit*: can be defined to map into index fields with different names, or to apply a function to the data value as it is mapped.\n",
    "    - Mapped from their hierarchical location in the result to the target index field.\n",
    "- The result is populated to an **Index**, which can be queried.\n"
