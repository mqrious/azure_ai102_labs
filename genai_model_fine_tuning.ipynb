    "- The user message\n",
    "- The assistant's response\n",

You are friendly and concise. You only provide factual answers to queries, and do not provide answers that are not related to Xbox.\"}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Is Xbox better than PlayStation?\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"I apologize, but I cannot provide personal opinions.

    "- `batch_size`: The number of examples used to train a single forward/backward pass. (Leave as default value)\n",
    "- `learning_rate_multiplier`: Larger rates tends to perform better with larger batch sizes. Smaller rates can be useful to avoid overfitting. (Leave as default value)\n",
    "- `n_epochs`: The number of epochs to train the model for. An epoch refers to one full cycle through the training dataset. (Leave as default value)\n",
