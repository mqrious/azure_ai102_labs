    "# The Semantic Kernel Agents Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "It is part of the core Semantic Kernel framework, provides structured components for defining AI-driven workflows, enabling agents to interact with users, APIs, and external services.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core concepts\n",
    "- **Agents**: They use language models, functions, and memory to make decisions dynamically.\n",
    "- **Agent collaboration**: Agents (of different types) can collaborate together through an agent group chat. Agent group chats determine which agent should respond and how to determine if the conversation is finished.\n",
    "- **Kernel**: central component of the Semantic Kernel, acts as the execution engine, managing AI interactions, function orchestration, and memory.\n",
    "- **Tools and plugins**: Agents use tools and plugins to perform specific tasks.\n",
    "- **History**: Agents can maintain chat history across multiple interactions, allowing them to track previous interactions and adapt responses accordingly. The conversation history is always accessible by the agents, either as a whole or for a specific agent's chat history.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of agents\n",
    "- **Azure AI Agent**: a specialized agent within the Semantic Kernel Agent Framework. The AzureAIAgent also supports a variety of built-in tools, including file retrieval, code execution, and data interaction via Bing, Azure AI Search, Azure Functions, and OpenAPI.\n",
    "- **Chat Completion Agent**: designed for chat completion and conversation interfaces. The ChatCompletionAgent type mirrors the features and patterns in the underlying AI Service to support natural language processing, contextual understanding, and dialogue management.\n",
    "- **OpenAI Assistant Agent**: designed for more advanced capabilities and multi-step tasks. The OpenAIAssistantAgent type supports goal-driven interactions with additional features like code interpretation and file search.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Agent group chat\n",
    "- **Single-turn conversation**: a designated agent provides a response based on user input.\n",
    "    - You can invoke a response from a single-turn chat by using AgentGroupChat.invoke and specifying the agent that should respond\n",
    "- **Multi-turn conversation**: multiple agents take turns responding, continuing the conversation until a termination condition is met.\n",
    "    - Agent responses are returned asynchronously as they are generated, allowing the conversation to unfold in real-time.\n",
    "    - You can invoke a response from a multi-turn chat by using `AgentGroupChat.invoke`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Agent selection strategy\n",
    "It's important to choose the agent that's best suited to respond to a user's query, especially in multi-agent systems where the agents specialize in different domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Single-turn conversations**: \n",
    "- **Intent recognition**: The framework analyzes the user's query to identify the intent and match it with the most relevant agent.\n",
    "- **Predefined rules**: Developers can configure routing rules to direct specific queries to designated agents in their application.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multi-turn conversations**:\n",
    "- **Context tracking**: The framework maintains a record of the conversation history to understand the user's intent and select the appropriate agent.\n",
    "- **Dynamic switching**: If the topic shifts, the framework dynamically switches to an agent specializing in the new domain in the middle of the conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The selection strategy is defined within the framework either by using predefined selection strategy or by extending a `SelectionStrategy` class. Predefined are:\n",
    "- `SequentialSelectionStrategy`: select the agent based on the order in which the agents were added to the chat, has the option to specify an initial agent.\n",
    "- `KernelFunctionSelectionStrategy`: allows you to define your selection strategy by creating a kernel function from a prompt.\n",
    "- `SelectionStrategy`: base class with an overridable `select_agent` method that returns the agent name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Truncating chat history: To reduce token usage and help improve performance use the `KernelFunctionSelectionStrategy.history_reducer` parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Termination strategy\n",
    "A termination strategy ensures that conversations or tasks conclude appropriately. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each termination strategy supports a maximum_iterations parameter that will end the chat after a maximum number of iterations. The default value is 99 iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `DefaultTerminationStrategy`: will only terminate after the specified number of maximum iterations.\n",
    "- `KernelFunctionTerminationStrategy`: allows you to define your termination strategy by creating a kernel function from a prompt. This class requires a `result_parser` parameter, which is a Boolean function that processes the output of your prompt function to determine whether the termination condition has been met.\n",
    "- `TerminationStrategy`: base class with an overridable `should_agent_terminate` method that returns a Boolean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Truncating chat history: To reduce token usage and help improve performance use the `KernelFunctionTerminationStrategy.history_reducer` parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conversation state\n",
    "The AgentGroupChat state updates to 'completed' once it meets the termination criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep using the same chat instance, you'll need to reset the completion state to False. Without a state reset, the AgentGroupChat can't accept new interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a conversation hits the maximum number of iterations allowed, the conversation will end but won't be marked as 'completed'. In this case, you can extend the conversation without resetting the conversation state."
